Lab 3

Intro
I have learned how to use LC3 instructions. I learned that GETC allows user
to input only one char at a time, so I needed to use loops in order to let user 
to enter multiple chars at one time.

Algorithms
I have broken down my code into many blocks/procedures. I have used
the JSR control instruction because it is similar to C/Java.
Basically, the subroutine is separate from the program, and 
at one point when we say JSR MULTIPLICATOPN, this means that call
the MULTIPLICATION procedure (no conditions), execute code in MULTIPLICATION
and return back to the original procedure. I found this a simple way
to undergo conditions. However, this meant I had to keep my r7 clear.
Converting to two's complement was easy, just inverting (NOT) user input
and adding a 1 to the result.

MASK
I had a very hard time understanding the bit mask operation needed
in this lab and I watched many videos and read many documentations on this topic.
Basically, we need the bit mask in order to go through the binary
string and tell us where there are 1. We use 16 masks because our
binary output is 16 bit. I use R2 to load the MASK into, and then I must
create a loop which will AND each of the mask value with my stored value.
Basically, if I get a positive value (first bit should be 0), I add 1 to my counter and repeat
the process with the remaining 15 masks until there are none left.

Conclusion
Overall, this was a pretty tough lab and I had to use many resources
and watch various online lecture. I also don't like the explanation of MASK
I found so I had to deduce the meaning behind it myself which was really frustrating
but I am glad now that I understand it.
