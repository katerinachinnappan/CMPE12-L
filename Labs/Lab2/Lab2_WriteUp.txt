Description/Purpose

In this lab we learned how registers and MUX works. We learned how to
build a register, full adders and invert bits. Even though I didnt' quite get the result
I wanted, I still understood the flow of logic.


Procedure

First, I built a 6 bit register which meant I had 6 D-flip flops. Each flip flop was controlled
by a clock, and a rest button. The flip flops were connected to two 7 segment LED which displayed the data.
I then built 6 full bit adders, and connected them to the register as well.
I didn't quite finish building the MUX.

Challenges

This lab was pretty challenging. I had a lot of issues setting up this lab
and connecting things together. It was hard for me to understand for a long time how
things work but now I understand even though my lab still doesn't quite work.

Conclusion

Basically, this was a very challenging lab. The most challenging part was to set up the MUX anc connectg all
the components together. Setting up the register and full adders was quite simple, however the subtraction part was prettty
challenging. I now know how a computer adds and subtracts numbers and how easy it is for a computer and how hard it is for me.
